    /// A tree-based analog to [`fold`](Iterator::fold).
    ///
    /// Folds every node in the tree into an accumulated value by applying an operation,
    /// returning the final result.
    ///
    /// fold() takes one arguments: a closure with two arguments: an ‘accumulator’ (the
    /// result of accumulating both children of the current node), and the current node's
    /// value. The closure returns the value that the accumulator should have for the
    /// subtree's parent's iteration.
    ///
    /// After applying this closure to every element of the iterator, fold() returns the
    /// accumulator.
    ///
    /// Folding is useful whenever you have a tree of something, and want to produce a
    /// single value from it.
    ///

    ///     value: 0,
    ///     left: Some(Box::new(BinaryTree {
    ///         value: 1,
    ///         left: None,
    ///         right: None,
    ///     })),
    ///     right: Some(Box::new(BinaryTree {
    ///         value: 2,
    ///         left: None,
    ///         right: Some(Box::new(BinaryTree {
    ///             value: 3,
    ///             left: None,
    ///             right: None,
    ///         })),
    ///     })),

    ///     tree.into_pipeline()
    ///         .fold_tree(|children, value| {
